        <h2>Work and Project</h2>
        <hr />

        <h3>1. Ant Group, December 2018 - Present, Shanghai</h3>

        <h5>Stock Business, June 2023 - Present</h5>

        <ul>
          <li>
            With the stability of the pension business, I returned to the stock business in the middle of 2023.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Pension Business, August 2022 - June 2023</h5>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Towards the end of 2022, the individual pension policy was issued.

            On the eve of policy announcement, I joined the pension team to undertake the opening up task.
          </li>

          <li>
            The pension business had been preparing for the opening of individual pension accounts for a long time, but
            the system's stability was not reliable.

            After joining the team, I reviewed the solutions and implementations of key processes and corrected some
            issues.

            For example, I adjusted the design of the switch for traffic cutting, which was not reasonable, making it
            possible to support both pre and post-opening states, allowing for continuous iteration.

            I completely took over the major promotional project, discussed the gameplay with the product team, reviewed
            the code line by line for
            the promotion, and deployed it before the public release.

            Based on past experience, I realized traffic cutting would be a crucial feature for the opening, so I made
            technical preparations in advance.

            Ultimately it supported the opening to be launched externally at the project team level, Ant Group, Alibaba
            Group, city level, and percentage level.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Securities Wealth Management Business, January 2022 - August 2022</h5>

        <uL>
          <li>
            During this period, I worked with two colleagues to follow up securities wealth management business.

            In addition to coding, my daily tasks also included requirement evaluation, project allocation, and
            technical
            planning.

            For example, I assisted team members to analyze and optimize the performance of the home page index RPC,
            resolving the issue of increased response time caused by server restart during system deployment.
          </li>
        </uL>


        <h5>Stock, Pension, Investment Research, Community Business, April 2020 - December 2021</h5>

        <ul>
          <li>
            In April 2020, a new colleague joined the company and was appointed as the team leader.

            We started to build a new team, and the team was required to be able to flexibly support the work of the
            higher-level team.

            I went through frequent personnel changes in this time period.

            As a core developer, I took the lead in various projects such as Stock, Pension, Investment Research, and
            Communities, proving the team's combat effectiveness.

            Eventually, the team gained recognition from the organization and was entrusted with the complete
            responsibility for the Stock business, while the smaller-scale businesses were separated.
          </li>

          <li>
            After taking over the Pension business, I happened to face the need for a major overhaul of wealth and
            insurance integration.

            As the person in charge, I completed most of the work from requirements analysis to development and finally
            successfully published this project.

            During the intense development period, I also optimized some experience issues that were discovered, such as
            the flashing issue when loading the homepage.

            Due to the complexity of the logic in the header cards of the homepage, the architecture design divided the
            data processing of the homepage into two models (the page model and the header card model).

            Analysis revealed that the header card processing took a long time, while the overall structure of the page
            was relatively simple and could be processed quickly.

            If the page data was already processed and rendered, and then the header card was processed and then
            rendered. Thus the header card would push other cards below. This execution process caused the flashing
            issue.

            The solution was to add temporal control between the two models.

            When the header card model's data processing is completed, the page model can submit data to render.

            Finally, the problem was perfectly solved.
          </li>

          <li>
            In the Investment Research business, we need to develop an internal web application to display the data
            produced by the financial engineering team.

            Additionally, we need to develop an external web application that was a subset of the internal application.

            The applications were built using the BFF (Backend For Frontend) architecture, where one group
            of web page with node application provided internal services, and another group provided external
            services.

            I used npm packages to share web implementations, while the node layer used plugins to share interface
            implementations.

            I built the entire application system from scratch and led two outsourced colleagues in iterative
            development.

            This architecture had supported the growth of the business.
          </li>

          <li>
            In the Stock business, there were two main issues.

            First, H5 pages like the stock homepage had slow startup speeds and poor user experience.

            Second, developing using iOS/Android technologies required a large amount of manpower and had low efficiency
            for business development.

            To address these issues, we upgraded the Stock development mode based on Alipay's self-developed
            high-performance dynamic engine.

            My job was to establish the data link on the server side, integrate with the management backend, and
            encapsulate it into usable interfaces at the node layer.

            I collaborated with the client team to complete the upgrade. And it released successfully.

            After the upgrade, the average startup time of the stock homepage was reduced from 2000ms to 700ms.

            The efficiency of stock detail page development increased by 50% after taking this solution.
          </li>

          <li>
            Users' visits to different stocks on the stock detail page can reflect the current market trends.

            The front-end team reports user visit data and records it to the data warehouse, making us the closest role
            to the source of data.

            In this context, I took the initiative to learn the process of data cleansing in my spare time and created a
            report on the top UV for individual stock, index, and sector pages.

            Through word of mouth, there are now more than 10 operational colleagues from different business lines who
            have requested access to this report.

            It has played a role in assisting business decision-making.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>High-net-worth Wealth Management Business, December 2018 - March 2020</h5>

        <ul>
          <li>When I joined the team, the business development was in progress and not yet launched externally.

            It was necessary to quickly complete the development of various functional modules and complete end-to-end
            integration to ensure business expansion at any time.

            The front-end team was consisted of 3 people. In the early stages, I was responsible for developing a
            mini-program of dual recording (audio and video), and later I was responsible for the entire front-end
            project.

            Ultimately, the business was successfully launched to the outside world in the middle of 2019.
          </li>

          <li>Under the 2018 new regulations for asset management of China, it should make audio and video
            recordings before purchasing trust products.

            I developed a dual recording mini-program for this purpose.

            The dual recording mini-program relied on many basic capabilities provided by other teams, such as TTS audio
            synthesis, audio playback, audio recording, video recording, and mini-program framework.

            Integrating these basic capabilities to build the business application required resolving numerous
            compatibility issues.

            For example, on Android devices, the duration of TTS audio was always shorter than the actual audio
            duration, resulting in abnormal progress bar display for audio playback.

            After failing to find a solution from the multimedia team, I collected data points and conducted visual
            analysis .

            I discovered a fixed multiple relationship (always equal to 1/2 of the actual value) between the TTS audio
            duration
            callback value and the actual value.

            Based on this finding, I corrected the problem and improved the user experience.

            After multiple rounds of optimization, the pass rate for dual recording tests increased from
            being almost unusable initially to 70%, effectively supporting the expansion of trust business.
